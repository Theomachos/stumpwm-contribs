Stumpwm helpers etc.

* wicd
The wicd commands are as follows:
- wicd-connect --- provides a menu to select the desired network
- wicd-disconnect --- disconnect from whatever is currently active
- wicd-scan-and-connect --- performs wireless scan first, then supplies menu prompt
  
The basic functions should be portable.

Additionally there is a status report that displays after attempting a
new connection. For the master branch, it is only provided for sbcl
and ccl currently. In the dbus branch, it should work everywhere that
the dbus library works.

To use the dbus branch you must first install:
