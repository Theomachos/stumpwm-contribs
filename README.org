Stumpwm helpers etc.

* wicd
The wicd commands are as follows:
- wicd-connect --- provides a menu to select the desired network
- wicd-disconnect --- disconnect from whatever is currently active
- wicd-scan-and-connect --- performs wireless scan first, then supplies menu prompt
  
The basic functions should be portable. Additionally there is a status
report that displays after attempting a new connection, but it is only
provided for sbcl and ccl currently.
